<h1>MAP for day 7 - RASTER</h1>
<h2>1500 YEARS OF CITY GROWTH.</h2>
<p>24 Lisbon city maps were superimposed, starting from the 4th century, until 1904-1911 (dates of the field work for the last map). The colours grow darker as the years progress. On the background is shown a modern city map, which allows comparisons with the misalignments found in most of the ancient maps.</p>
<p>Rasters drawn over a variety of ancient maps from several sources and put together as superimposed layers in #Photoshop. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>
<p>Map data © mostly Câmara Municipal de Lisboa.</p>
