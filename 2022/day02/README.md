<h1>MAP for day 2 - LINES</h1>
<h2>Ariadne's thread - Creating contour lines and a Digital Elevation Model by drawing and processing a large number of paths.</h2>
<p>The ideia was taken from a <a href="https://youtu.be/watch?v=bLbY3iMBW-A">YouTube video</a> made by Monde Geospatial. The DEM is the end result of a processing pipeline which includes Google Earth, TCX Converter, Excel and QGIS.</p>
<p>The large image shows the coverage of a small area of the city. The inset images show the full path coverage of the whole municipality (top), contour lines generated at 10m interval (middle) and the resulting DEM (bottom).</p>
<p>This proof of concept was tested using the 1911 municipality contour, slightly different from the current one.</p>
<p>Paths drawn in #GoogleEarth. KML files processed in TCX Converter and #Excel. DEM processed in #QGIS. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans. Map data ©2018 Google.</p>
<p>File listing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>30daymapchallenge__2022-day-02__lines.png - the MAP itself.</li>
  <li>kml.zip - all the KML files with paths drawn.</li>
  <li>csv.zip - the corresponding CSV to each KML, with altitude values.</li>
  <li>contour_lines.zip - set of files with the contour lines at 10 meter interval.</li>
  <li>dem.zip - the Digital Elevation Model in GeoTIFF format.</li>
  </ul>
