<h1>MAP for day 2 - LINES</h1>
<h2>Ariadne's thread - Creating contour lines and a Digital Elevation Model by drawing and processing a large number of paths.</h2>
The ideia was taken from a <a href="youtu.be/watch?v=bLbY3iMBW-A">YouTube video</a> made by Monde Geospatial. The DEM is the end result of a processing pipeline which includes Google Earth, TCX Converter, Excel and QGIS. 
The large image shows the coverage of a small area of the city. The inset images show the full path coverage of the whole municipality (top), contour lines generated at 10m interval (middle) and the resulting DEM (bottom).
This proof of concept was tested using the 1911 municipality contour, slightly different from the current one.
Paths drawn in #GoogleEarth. KML files processed in TCX Converter and #Excel. DEM processed in #QGIS. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans. Map data ©2018 Google.
