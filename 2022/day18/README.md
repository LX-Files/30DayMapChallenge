<h1>MAP for day 18 - COLOUR FRIDAY: BLUE</h1>
<h2>Bathymetry at the entry to the port of Lisbon in 1879</h2>
<p>This is an edit of an original map from 1857, updated in 1879. It shows the coast leading towards Lisbon, both from the South and from the West. On the rigth side the map ends where Lisbon begins, at Algés and Belém. The depth curves were taken from the original. However, I deliberately simplified the contents to allow a clearer view of the different blue areas. Also, that same original presented three different sets of depth curves, belonging to three measurements made along the years, so a bit of simplification was needed.</p>
