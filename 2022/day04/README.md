<h1>MAP for day 4 - GREEN</h1>
<h2>EVERYTHING THAT IS GREEN IN LISBON.</h2>
<p>Every element in the city of Lisbon that is related to the color green, present in the OpenStreetMap database, not only of natural origin, but also as part of a 'green infrastructure'. Further information was added, extracted from open data provided by the city hall regarding tree coverage and cycleways.</p>
<p>The large green blob on the left side of the map is the Monsanto Forest Park, vital to the air quality of the city. On the top of the map the airport also appears in the midlle of a large green area, simply because of all the grass surrounding the runways, not really accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Green elements extracted from local .OSM.PBF file with osmium. Manual editing in #JOSM. Map styling in #QGIS. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.  Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors and Câmara Municipal de Lisboa.</p>
