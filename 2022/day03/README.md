<h1>MAP for day 3 - POLYGONS</h1>
<h2>Landuse in Lisbon, according to OpenStreetMap.</h2>
<p>The majority of the polygons are classified as 'residential'. Polygons were colored according to the MapCSS definitions, with a slight tweaking of the colors to improve visibility.</p>
<p>By leaving aside streets and city limits, the shape of the city appears as a series of colored islands, floating in a void.</p>
<p>Polygons extracted from local .OSM.PBF file with osmium and saved in GeoJSON format. Map styling in #QGIS. Image editing in #Photoshop. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.  Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors</p>
