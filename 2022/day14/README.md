<h2>DISTRIBUTION OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY LISBON MUNICIPALITY</h2>
<p>Two spatial histograms regarding water access in the Lisbon municipality in the first decade of the 20th century. Blue shows water well density and red shows water storage tank density. City streets at the time are shown in gray. Both water wells and storage tanks were needed outside the more populated areas. On either case, higher densities were found near the smaller isolated population centers that were already part of the municipality, but not quite considered as a true part of the city (something that does not happen today). There was already a water distribution network, but it didn't yet reach those smaller centers, that had to rely on local solutions for their needs. Some of the darker spots near the river can also be justified with the concentration of specific industries in those places.</p>
