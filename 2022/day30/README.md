<h1>MAP for day 30 - REMIX</h1>
<h2>PLAYING WITH GEOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>A simple deck of cards, with a geographic theme. 52 cards in four suits, 13 ranks for each suit. I took maps of the 13 largest cities in the world (according to the UN population estimates for 2018) and split them across the 4 cards for each rank. Each card shows a small section of the map. When the 4 cards are put together, a larger portion of the map appears, as shown on the image above.</p>
<p>Think of it as a way to pass the time, until the next edition of the challenge.</p>
<p>Images captured via MapStack from Stamen Studio. Raster images edited in #Photoshop. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this work came from a deck published in Germany, in 1838, the so called <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Court_game_of_geography"><i>Court Game of Geography</i></a>.
