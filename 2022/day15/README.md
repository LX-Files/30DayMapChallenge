<h2>SAUSAGES, BLOOD PUDDINGS AND SMOKED MEATS IN CONTINENTAL PORTUGAL.</h2>
<p>This maps shows all kinds of typical local products made (mostly) with pork meat, pork blood and a host of other ingredients. Inspiration came from the book <i>Entre ventos e fumos</i> (<i>Between wind and smoke</i>, literal translation) by the portuguese chef Nuno Diniz. The sheer amount and variety – close to 120 different products – are a testimony to the presence of this type of food in Portugal. I kept the original names because most of them are virtually untranslatable.</p>
<p>The mix of ingredients is astonishing. 
If pork meat and pork blood are nearly essential to all of them, lots of additional things turn each product into its own world of flavour – salt, parsley, garlic, onions, laurel, paprika, pepper, cumin, bread, corn flour, rye flour, wheat flour, green wine, red wine, white wine, vinegar, pork entrails, lard, meat from other animals such as chicken, turkey, cow or rabbit, orange, pumpkin, turnip, beetroot, honey, yellow sugar, cinammon, acorn, nuts, olive oil... the list goes on and on. And, of course, lots of smoke, from different types of wood. The fact that many of these products are still handmade, makes the same set of ingredients taste differently, even when the end result has the same name or look.</p>
