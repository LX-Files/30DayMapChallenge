<h1>MAP for day 11 - COLOUR FRIDAY: RED</h1>
<h2>HOW MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD HAVE 'SOMETHING RED' IN THEIR FLAGS?</h2>
<p>Actually there are 153. And how do some other flag colours compare? This is not a true exercise in vexilology, but only a way to quickly relate the colour 'red' with others. Also, I took some liberties regarding colour tones and so on, counting together white and silver, or yellow and gold, as well as merging several different tones of green or blue.</p>
<p>Sorry if I misrepresent any country.</p>
