<h1>MAP for day 24 - FANTASY</h1>
<h2>LOTHARINGIA VASTUM REGNUM</h2>
<p>Neither did I draw this map, nor is it a fantasy one. However, I found its streamlined graphic style and general appearence rather adequate to the brief in hand. Hills, mountains, forests and cities are presented in a sparse and symbolic way, with color used to emphasize importance where it is needed. And yet, it is simply an upside down representation of a wide area, spanning parts of France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg, covering approximately 610 Km2 (380 sqm).</p>
<p>On the left, the original map, with place names and comments in Latin and German, shows part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotharingia">Kingdom of Lotharingia</a>, which existed between the 9th and 10th centuries. On the right the approximate same area is shown, in the OpenStreetMap version. The map on the left is turned upside down. The city shown at the bottom, Treveris, corresponds to modern day Trier, in Germany, which stands on the top of the map on the right.</p>
<p>The smaller inset maps emphasize some of the waterways that cross the area, including rivers such as the Moselle, the Saar, the Meurthe, the Mortagne, the Meuse and the Seille, all of them identified by name, in German, on the original map. To make the comparison easier, this time the inset map on the rigth is turned upside down. The general shape of the rivers is the same.</p>
<p>This map appears in an atlas titled <i>Ptolemaeus auctus restitutus emaculatus cum tabulis veteribus ac novis</i>, dated from 1520. It is in the Public Domain and can be downloaded from <a href="https://purl.pt/29894">https://purl.pt/29894</a>
