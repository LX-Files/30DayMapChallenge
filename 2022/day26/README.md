<h1>MAP for day 26 - ISLANDS</h1>
<h2>THE ISLANDS AND ISLETS OF THE ALQUEVA DAM</h2>
<p>Most of the lakes found in Portugal are artificial ones, created by hydroelectric dams. As such, lake islands are not overly abundant - that is, until the building of the Alqueva dam, finished in 2002. When the lake was completely filled, in early 2010, it became the largest artificial lake in Western Europe - and both islands and islets appeared by the dozen. Some of them may not be of a permanent nature, due to changes in the water level.</p>
<p>The smaller map shows the location of the lake in Portugal, parts of it being shared with Spain. The border is shown with
a dashed orange line.</p>
