<h1>MAP for day 20 - MY FAVOURITE</h1>
<h2>Nine views of my favourite city, Lisbon, in Portugal.</h2>
<p>These nine views were obtained through online map generators, which allow the quick selection of a given area in the world, and present the appropriate map. The variety of graphic styles available in each generator, provide different views into the same content. I selected nine views, but could have easily doubled that amount.</p>
<p>The styles present are, left to right, top to bottom: satellite view (PDF Map Maker), OpenTopoMap style (MapOSMatic), CiclOSM style (MapOSMatic),
MapQuest Europe hybrid style (MapOSMatic), Watercolor style (Stamen Design), Toner style (Stamen Design), Dark style (PDF Map Maker), Emerald style 
(PDF Map Maker) and OpenArdenneMap style (MyOSMatic).</p>
<p>Raster images edited in #Photoshop. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>
