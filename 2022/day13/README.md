<h1>MAP for day 13 - 5 MINUTE MAP</h1>
<h2>PLANET EARTH</h2>
<p>A map made in 5 minutes of less, 'drawn' from a single character of the font Europe, created by @woodcutterBCN.</p>
<p>I opted to use Microsoft Word, given the sense of urgency presented in the original brief. At least in my computer it starts quickly, allowing to write something and applying one of the default WordArt styles. Both the map and the description were placed in independent text boxes, to allow custom positioning on the page.</p>
<p>Text editing in #Word, converted to PDF. Conversion to image format in #Photoshop. Fonts used: Europa and FiraSans.</p>

<p>File listing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>30daymapchallenge__2022-day-13__5-minute-map.png</b> - the MAP itself.</li>
  <li><b>planet_earth.docx</b> - the Word document containing the editable version.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the map to be edited, it is necessary to install the Europe font. It is available <a href="https://www.dafont.com/es/europe.font">here</a>.<p>
