<h1>MAP for day 12 - SCALE</h1>
<h2>When the world is small enough, you can walk everywhere!</h2>
<p>This map appears inside a 50 m diameter compass rose, located riverside in Lisbon, in front of the Monument to the Discoveries. It measures 14 m from one side to the other, with the approximate scale of 1:1.736.000 - practical enough to go on foot anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I took these photos in 2009. Their resolution is not the best by today's standards, but I had no time to repeat them for the challenge.</p>
<p>Image editing in #Photoshop. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>
