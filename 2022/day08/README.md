<h2>WINDPOWER – THE ETERNAL USEFULNESS OF A NATURAL ELEMENT</h2>
<p>This map of the Portuguese continental territory shows the distribution of windmills and wind turbines. They both represent temporal extremes of using a specific natural element - the wind.</p>
<p>Windmills have been used in Portugal probably since the 13th century. Wind turbines saw their numbers increase enormously since the first decade of this century. The current installed capacity excedes 5.600 MW.</p>
<p>There is a clear geographic division between the two. Windmills are clustered mostly nearer the Atlantic coast, with a strong presence immediately north of Lisbon. Wind turbines are preferably located on the mountains, mostly on the northern half of the country.</p>
<p>Windmills and wind turbines extrated from local .OSM.PBF file with osmium. Manual editing in #JOSM. Map styling in #QGIS. Final composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>
