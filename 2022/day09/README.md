<h1>MAP for day 9 - SPACE</h1>
<h2>Creating the illusion of space with a sparse point cloud - or, a sparse point cloud view of Lisbon, taken from São Pedro de Alcântara.</h2>
<p>In 2008 I used 1100 photos in Microsoft's Photosynth to reconstruct a view taken from a hill in Lisbon, São Pedro de Alcântara, one of its best known viewpoints. Later on it was possible to use third party software to extract further information from the synth, including the underlying point cloud. Although not really dense - only 232.184 points for a visible area of about 2.15 Km2 (0.83 sq mi) - it is enough to recognize the general layout of several areas of the city. Of course that it helps to have seen it beforehand, so I provide a couple of photos to compare.</p>
<p>Photosynth from Microsoft wasn't meant to create dense point clounds, only the ones resulting from using a series of photos to recreate a 3D space. However, given a large number of photos, it was possible to obtain something akin to a 3D reconstruction, and sometimes it was possible to get denser point clouds. It was a sad day when Microsoft shut down the service, in 2017.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>30daymapchallenge__2022-day-09__space.png</b> - partial view of the point cloud.</li>
  <li><b>detail.png</b> - detailed view of a smaller portion of the city included in the point cloud (from Google Earth).</li>
  <li><b>panorama_medium.jpg</b> - a panoramic view of the whole area included in the point cloud, in medium quality.</li>
  <li><b>spedro.x3d</b> - the point cloud in X3D format.<li>
