<h2>PAPERCRAFT LISBON (a work in progress)</h2>
<p>A 3D representation of the Lisbon DEM, with the sattelite view of the same area mapped onto the surface.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to finish this 3D representation of Lisbon in time for this day, but wanted to share it all the same. The process is a bit convoluted. In order to have a physical representation of the Lisbon DEM, 3D printing would be an obvious answer. However, I also wanted a colored surface representation - an aerial view mapped onto a 3D surface. With no easy or cheap way to get that result, either by printing or thermoforming, I opted for the one method within practical (?) reach - papercraft. The project scale would be 1:25000.</p>
<p>The necessary steps were:</p>
<ul>
<li>In QGIS, I used the 'DEM 3D printing' plugin and a Lisbon DEM, to create a grid of 6*6 STL files, as if the objective was a classic 3D print; I used a vertical exaggeration value of 3.</li>
<li>Using MeshLab, I simplified the meshes, reducing the triangle count to 200 per segment; this simplification is vital to allow manual work.</li>
<li>From Google Earth, I captured a satellite view corresponding to the DEM area./li>
<li>Using Photoshop, the full raster of that capture was split into 36 segments.</li>
<li>Using Adobe Dimension, I performed UV mapping on each STL, aligning each of the 36 satellite rasters over the corresponding 3D segment.</li>
<li>Each 3D segment was imported to Pepakura Designer, to create the appropriate unfolded version, ready to print and assemble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the papercraft segments were ready to print, I had to insert an additional step using Illustrator, to perform some rather minimal resizing operations, but only because I had a rather obtuse problem with printer drivers.</p>
<p>The models were printed on 120 g/m2 sheets of A3 paper. </p>
<p>Of course, there was a lot of trial and error involved in this project. But it worked.</p>
