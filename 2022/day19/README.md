<h1>MAP for day 19 - GLOBE</h1>
<h2>The Waldseemüller gores of 1507 as a papercraft model</h2>
<p>In 1507 the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller published a wall map of the world, the <i>Universalis Cosmographia</i>, which was the first to use the name "America". On the same year he also published a set of gores for contructing a globe, also identifying "America". The photos show the process of printing and assembling these gores as a papercraft model, albeit with some irregularities.</p>
<p>Gores and photos edited in #Photoshop. Gore size adjustment and collage composition in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>
