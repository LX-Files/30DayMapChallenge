<h1>MAP for day 22 - NORTH IS NOT ALWAYS UP</h1>
<h2>SOMETIMES, INSTEAD OF LOOKING UP, YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO THE RIGHT</h2> 
<p>I'm not the author of this map. This is the first known map of Portugal, drawn between 1559 and 1561 by Fernando Alvares Seco, a Portuguese mathematician and cartographer. It was first published in Rome, in 1561 and later included in the <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</i>, the world's first atlas.</p>
<p>The map is oriented with the north located on the right. It is an unusual way of presenting the country, but at the same time particularly adaptable to a later inclusion in a formal book, making good use of two consecutive pages.</p>
<p>Raster editing in <b>Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b><br>
