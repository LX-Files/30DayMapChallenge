<h2>REBUILDING LISBON, ONE SQUARE AT A TIME</h2> 
<p>After the 1755 earthquake, a large portion of Lisbon was rebuilt. The main downtown area was defined between two large squares - Rossio and Praça do Comércio (Commerce Square). The essential structure resulting from the reconstruction still exists today, featuring an iconic orthogonal grid of streets beginning at Praça do Comércio and extending inland from the river.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, various proposals were considered for rebuilding and restructuring the city. The Commerce Square remained central to these efforts, albeit in different versions. Instead of envisioning a new version for today, I chose to utilize an automated reconstruction of the current one. Using COLMAP software and starting from 1880 photos of the square taken from nearly every angle, I created a 3D version. This Structure-from-Motion-based approach, yielding a dense point cloud containing over 37 million points, vividly captures the dimensional aspect of the square, as shown in the top image.</p>
<p>From top to bottom the images show (1) the dense point cloud resulting from the Multi-View Stereo processing stage in COLMAP, (2) a detail of the reconstruction and (3) every camera position detected from each photograph.</p>
