<h1>MAP for day 21 - RASTER</h1>
<h2>200 YEARS OF VALLEY MAPPING</h2> 
<p>The valley of Alcântara cuts through a part of Lisbon, bordering the Monsanto Forest Park. The eponymous river has long been relocated underground. The valley is crossed by a famous monument, the Aqueduct of Águas Livres, which delivered water to Lisbon from the mid-18th century to the mid-20th century. For centuries, this area served as a natural limit of the city.</p>
<p>Mapmakers have depicted the terrain since the beginning of the 19th century with varying degrees of effectiveness. The small map fragments exhibit several approaches, from various types of line shading to the use of color and precise contour lines. The larger image on the left displays a LiDAR-captured point representation of the valley terrain, including the aqueduct, from a survey conducted a couple of years ago.</p>
