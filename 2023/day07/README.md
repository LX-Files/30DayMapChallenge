<h1>MAP for day 7 - NAVIGATION</h1>
<h2>CYBERCARTOGRAPHY - EXPLORING A PROTOTYPE WEBSITE NAVIGATION MAP</h2> 
<p>This is a prototype navigation map belonging to a proposal presented in the early stages of the redesign of an institutional website, circa 2006. As the web site would be based on a content management system, not every page is shown - quite a few would be generated on demand, appearing here in a symbolic fashion behind others with stronger colours. Later on this structure - or another similiar one - would be included in the final product as the website map. However, this specific redesign never happened.</p>
<p>Original map drawn in <b>Microsoft Visio</b> and later exported to raster format. Image editing in <b>Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>.
