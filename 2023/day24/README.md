<h1>MAP for day 24 - BLACK & WHITE</h1>
<h2>EVERY WAY USED FOR TRANSPORTATION IN LISBON</h2> 
<p>A white-on-black dump of every way tagged for transportation in Lisbon, as defined in the OpenStreetMap database. This includes all manner of highways, aeroways, and routes. I have chosen not to include a legend, as the presentation constraints and graphic styling make the identification of all features very difficult — it's just a dense network of vectors.</p>
<p>Highway, aeroway and route elements extracted from a local .PBF file with <b>osmium</b>. Manual editing in <b>JOSM</b>. Map styling in <b>QGIS</b>. Image editing in <b>Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>.<br>
