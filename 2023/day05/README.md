<h1>MAP for day 5 - ANALOG MAP</h1>
<h2>AN ANALOG MAP IN THE PROCESS OF GOING DIGITAL</h2> 
<p>In the late 1980s, I was part of an academic project aimed at creating software for a computing workstation tailored to the needs of historians. Although it was never finished, resulting in only a series of nearly complete versions, it left me with a lifelong appreciation of the many ways computers can be used to solve problems across various fields, including cartography. Given the importance of geographic data in historical research, including mapping functionality in the basic requirements for that workstation was inevitable. Cartographic data was expensive at the time (the term 'open data' was not commonly used, if at all), and projects such as OpenStreetMap were just distant dreams (the World Wide Web hadn't been invented yet!). Therefore, we decided to develop our own cartography software.</p>
<p>The image depicts a hand-drawn map of the northern region of Portugal, meticulously rendered on millimeter graph paper. This map outlines the primary administrative divisions, complete with coded pencil annotations and variable names. The purpose of this drawing was to serve as a reference for creating raster versions of different areas within the country. Simultaneously, work was underway to define the shapes of these regions as vector-traced polygons. This cartographic project, which we can refer to as the nascent stages of a GIS platform, was developed in C and had to contend with the constraints of graphics-intensive software during a time predating the widespread adoption of Windows.</p>
<p>Image scanned from the millimiter graph paper original. Given the time distance, I don’t remember the physical map that was used as the basis for the tracing operations. Image editing in <b>#Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>#Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>.
