<h2>EXPLORING COMPLEX ROAD STRUCTURES: ACHIEVING VISUAL HARMONY</h2> 
<p>In the world's most populous continent, the task of moving large numbers of people from one place to another by road presents intriguing challenges. Multi-tiered concrete roadworks may not be the most aesthetically pleasing urban landmarks. However, when viewed from above, 'form follows function' and it becomes possible to discover, if not beauty, at least a sense of harmony in the overall shapes.</p>
<p>These are nine highly complex road structures located in Asia, presented from East to West. While opinions about their complexity may vary when compared to similar structures on other continents, one of them consistently holds the rather unique distinction of being recognized as the most complex road interchange in the world—the Huanqjuewan Junction in Chongqing, China.</p>
