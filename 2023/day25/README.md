<h1>MAP for day 25 - ANTARCTICA</h1>
<h2>THE FANTASTIC LAND OF 'MAGALLA NICA'</h2> 
<p>While growing up, there was a map similar to this one hanging on one of the walls of my parents' house. I don't remember how old I was when I started to really look at it, understanding that it was an old map, and so on.</p>
<p>One thing that stuck with me for quite some time was that large piece of land at the bottom of the map. Before making a connection between that land and 'Antarctica,' I imagined a fantastic territory called 'Magalla Nica' (as it was written on the map). The name sounded cool, and as far as I could see, it did not appear in modern maps.</p>
<p>So, here's to that place at the end of the world, the fantastic land of 'Magalla Nica'!</p>
