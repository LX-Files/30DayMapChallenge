<h1>MAP for day 6 - RASTER</h1>
<h2>GETTING THE MESSAGE ACCROSS</h2>
<p>This is a composite map, both old and new. It shows the portuguese telephone and telegraph network by the end of 1924, overlaying a Copernicus DEM from the period between 2011 and 2015. There was still an overabundance of telegraphic lines, as well as some semaphore stations spread along the coast.</p>
