<h1>MAP for day 4 - HEXAGONS</h1>
<h2>FOUR EXAMPLES OF HEXAGONS AS URBAN SHAPES</h2>
<p><i>&quot;In the realm of urban design, hexagonal planning is today virtually an unknown phenomenon, a mere oddity among a vast array of ideologies, theories and methods. It regularly goes unnoticed by students of city planning and urban history. Yet, for a period of almost 30 years, between 1904 and 1934, it caught the attention of various planners, engineers and architects who saw in it a promising panacea for the city’s planning ills and a replacement for the uniform rectangular street grid.&quot;</i>
