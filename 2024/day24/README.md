<h1>MAP for day 24: ONLY CIRCULAR SHAPES</h1>
<h2>DEFINING THE COURSE OF A RIVER WITH CIRCLES (AND HALF-CIRCLES, QUARTERS, AND SEGMENTS)</h2>
<p>The Sorraia River flows through the Ribatejo region of Portugal, crossing a valley renowned for its immense fertility. This river has supported agriculture and served as a transportation waterway since Roman times. Today, parts of the valley are intensively cultivated using center-pivot irrigation, which dots the landscape with a variety of circular shapes. To maximize the use of available land, not only full circles but also half-circles, quarter-circles, and smaller circular segments are employed.</p>
<p>The images provide different views of the Sorraia Valley, arranged as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Circular shapes plotted along the course of the river.</li>
<li>The same shapes overlaid on a digital elevation model (DEM) of the valley and surrounding terrain, along with the river’s course.</li>
<li>The previous image enriched with the nearby waterways and water elements in the vicinity of the valley.</li>
<li>A satellite view of the area with the circular shapes overlaid.</li></ul>
<p>While the circular patterns are more abundant on the southern margin of the river, their full distribution clearly indicates the presence of vital water sources for irrigation.</p>
