<h1>MAP for day 27: MICROMAPPING</h1>
<h2>MICROMAPPING AN ENTIRE CITY</h2>
<p>The <i>Silva Pinto 1911 City Plan</i> was the first highly detailed map of Lisbon created in the 20th century. Based on surveys conducted between 1904 and 1911, it presents the entire city at a 1:1000 scale, complete with color-coded details.</p>
<p>When I first began using the JOSM editor, I decided there was no better project to tackle than creating a digital twin of this historic map. For about a month, on and off, I worked on this ambitious task. It turned out to be a valuable introduction to the intricacies of digital cartography, teaching me about levels of detail, effective tagging, and the importance of aligning methods with intended outcomes.</p>
<p>Although the project remains incomplete, it served as a first step into the fascinating world of micromapping an entire city. I share it here as a testament to that initial effort. This small segment shows a portion of the coast centered on the Torre de Belém monument.</p>
