<h1>MAP for day 13 - A NEW TOOL</h1>
<h2>FAST TERRAIN GENERATION</h2>
<p>This is the 3D representation of a height map covering the Sintra Mountains near Lisbon. It was generated with the 3D Map Generator extension available for Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>By providing an existing height map from a real world location, or by drawing an imaginary one, 3D terrain generation complete with textures and icons, becomes quickly available. </p>
<p>The small icons show the location of Sintra by the foot of the mountain and Cape Roca, which is the westernmost point of mainland Portugal and continental Europe.</p>
