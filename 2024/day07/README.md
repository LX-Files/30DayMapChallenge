<h1>MAP for day 7 - VINTAGE STYLE</h1>
<h2>OR, BETTER YET, ANCIENT STYLE</h2>
<p>The top image shows a partial city plan of Lisbon in 2024, edited in a style resembling the oldest known plan of the city, depicted in the bottom image. This historical plan was originally drawn in 1650 by João Nunes Tinoco, a Portuguese architect, and serves as a primary source of knowledge about the city’s structure before the 1755 earthquake. The original plan is lost, and the version shown here is a copy published in 1884. The area in both images is the same, some streets in the upper left corner and at the bottom right remain nearly the same.</p>
<p>2024 city plan extracted from a local .OSM.PBF file with <b>#osmium</b> and edited in <b>#JOSM</b>. Styling in <b>#QGIS</b>. Raster editing in <b>#Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>#Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>.</p>
