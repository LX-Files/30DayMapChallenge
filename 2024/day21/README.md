<h1>MAP for day 21 - CONFLICT</h1>
<h2>DEFENDING LISBON</h2>
<p>During the early 19th century, in the broader context of the Peninsular War, Portugal was invaded three times by Napoleonic French armies. This conflict also involved Spain and the United Kingdom. With critical assistance from the British army, the French invaders were repelled each time.</p>
<p>Before the third invasion in 1810, a formidable defensive line was constructed north of Lisbon: the Lines of Torres Vedras. This strategic fortification proved invaluable, preventing the French from reaching Lisbon.</p>
<p>This map is a composite, based on a British army survey of the Lines conducted in 1818. The orange circles mark the locations of forts, redoubts, blockhouses, and artillery positions that comprised the Lines. The dual structure of the defenses leveraged the terrain, with most positions placed on elevated peaks to maximize the advantage for defenders.</p>
<p>Smaller inset images offer satellite views of several defensive positions. Many of these sites are accessible today, though their condition varies. Depending on their location, they may be found near the coast, within cities or villages, or standing isolated and overlooking valleys.</p>
