<h1>MAP for day 23: MEMORY</h1>
<h2>DISTORTING DOWNTOWN LISBON</h2>
<p>This map was likely drawn around 2008, based on its placement in a notebook with dated entries before and after this page. It represents a section of downtown Lisbon near the Tejo River, with satellite photos provided for comparison. The photo on the right includes a yellow overlay indicating the approximate area the drawing is meant to depict.</p>
<p>Due to the size limitation of the paper—A6 (4.1 x 5.8 inches)—I compressed the height of the drawing to make it fit. The map is intended to show key landmarks, including the town municipality building (1), the large Praça do Comércio square (2), and the well-known monument Casa dos Bicos (3), along with the streets connecting them.</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, I can no longer recall what I intended to represent with the two shapes labeled (4) and (5), as they seem to correspond to locations within the river.</p>
<p>When you're familiar with an area, you often sacrifice precision in favor of a quick sketch that conveys the essence of what you want to represent. If it makes sense to you, then that’s enough—or at least, that’s how it works for me. Nevertheless, this would also be a good contender for the “Bad Map” challenge!</p>
