<h1>MAP for day 10 - PEN & PAPER</h1>
<h2>A KING AND HIS COUNTRY</h2>
<p>These two maps were originally created as part of an unfinished article from the late 1980s. The article aimed to explore spatial concepts and geographical references present in the chancellery of King Pedro I, who ruled Portugal from 1357 to 1367. The study focused on population distribution across Portuguese territory in the latter half of the 14th century.</p>
<p>The map on the left, drawn in pencil over tracing paper, features numbered dots marking each location mentioned in historical documents. The map on the right, created with a rOtring technical pen on standard paper, represents the same locations with circles scaled to reflect the frequency of each reference.</p>
<p>Map outlines copied from a lost source onto tracing paper with pencil and onto drawing paper with <b>#rOtring</b> a technical pen. Raster editing in <b>#Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>#Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>.</p>
