<h1>MAP for day 12 - TIME AND SPACE</h1>
<h2>NOT THE SAME TIME BUT THE SAME SPACE</h2>
<p>These two images, separated by nearly 170 years, depict the same section of the Tejo River in Portugal, covering the route between Carregado (46 km upstream from Lisbon) and Alvega (164 km upstream).</p>
<p>The top image is the result of a survey initiated in 1852, conducted to explore the best methods for improving navigation on the river. The bottom image, by contrast, is a satellite view from 2023, offering a modern perspective of the same region.</p>
<p>A great deal has changed for the Tejo River in the intervening years. Dams have been constructed both in Portugal and Spain. The small image shows an example in Portugal. Today, water levels along much of the route allow for navigation only by small boats. Additionally, part of the river’s flow is diverted to southern Spain depending on the month and prevailing weather conditions across the Iberian Peninsula. As a result, in some areas along its Portuguese course, the water flow can dwindle to a trickle, making it possible to cross the river on foot.</p>
