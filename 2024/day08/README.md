<h2>TELL ME WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN PORTUGAL </h2>
<h3>(but don't talk about cities or population)</h3>
<p>Healthcare is essential to the well-being of a country's population. This map doesn’t show where the Portuguese population lives but rather where healthcare services are available. In some areas, data points are clustered, indicating high demand, while in others, single data points span large areas, suggesting lower demand. In these cases, it’s common to find only a pharmacy instead of a hospital, clinic, or medical practice, serving as a stopgap for basic healthcare needs.</p>
<p>Portugal has a National Health Service run by the state, complemented by a range of private providers. This dataset doesn’t distinguish between them. One thing is certain — whether public or private, the farther you go from the coast, the sparser the healthcare facilities become.</p>
<p>The majority of the Portuguese population lives alongside the coast. This dataset simply shows that in a different way.</p>
