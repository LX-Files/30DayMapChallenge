<h1>MAP for day 9 - A.I.</h1>
<h2>FOOD SPECIALTIES IN PORTUGAL</h2>
<p>It all started with the prompt "A map of Portugal showing where the best food specialties can be found".</p>
<p>And the winner is... DALL-E! But don't use the result as a true guide to things you can eat in Portugal. While some of the specialties listed do exist, others are either fictional or loosely identified. You can savor a real 'Pastel de Nata,' but be aware that similar-sounding names on this map may not correspond to actual treats. The 'Francesinha' is real, best tasted in Porto, but there is only one city with that name in the country - don't be misled. 'Bolo de Mel' is also a genuine specialty, though the finest come from the island of Madeira, which isn’t shown here. And as much as we love the sea, 'Seafool' isn’t a thing - look for 'Seafood' instead. 'Chanfana' is authentic, but 'Pastet de' is not. Overall, it’s a good effort, especially when compared to the outputs from other AI models. For comparison, the smaller images on the right are from Stability.ai’s Stable Diffusion (top), Midjourney (middle), and Adobe Firefly (bottom), none of which come close in terms of accuracy (at least Adobe's nailed the country shape).</p>
