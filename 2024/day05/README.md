<h1>MAP for day 5 - A JOURNEY</h1>
<h2>A LONG JOURNEY IS MADE UP OF MANY SMALL JOURNEYS (with evidence to show)</h2>
<p>In 2016, whenever I drove to work, I would park my car 1 km away from my workplace. After collecting all the parking stubs, each representing a short journey, I calculated a grand total of 264 km walked that year. Not bad for such a simple action! Of course, it would have been even better not to drive at all, but sometimes it couldn't be avoided.</p>
<p>The larger image shows a Google Earth screen capture with the routes I used (the city is Lisbon, Portugal). The inset image shows the pile of parking stubs from 2016. I kept them as a collection, never thinking I’d be using them eight years later.</p>
