<h2>THE LISBON BLUEPRINT</h2>
<p>In the 1840s, Sir John Herschel's work led to the development of several image reproduction techniques, including cyanotype - a process that produced distinctive blue copies. By the 1880s, cyanotype had become the foundation of a standardized method for copying plans in drawing offices worldwide, giving rise to the term "blueprint".</p>
<p>This map of Lisbon is presented as a blueprint. In Portugal, such reproductions were commonly referred to as "Marion copies", a case of genericide deriving from the ferro-prussiate reproduction process marketed by the British company Marion & Co. from the 1880s onward.</p>
