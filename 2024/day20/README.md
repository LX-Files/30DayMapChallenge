<h1>MAP for day 20 - DATA: OPENSTREETMAP</h1>
<h2>MAPPING PORTUGAL'S PEAKS</h2>
<p>This map displays all the peaks identified in the OSM database for mainland Portugal, overlaid on a digital elevation model (DEM). To maintain clarity, only peaks higher than 1000 meters are labeled; otherwise, the map would become cluttered with numbers.</p>
<p>The terrain elevation decreases as you move south, with nearly all high mountains located in the northern half of the country. While southern Portugal does have areas of rougher terrain, their elevation is modest compared to the north. Still, the highest peak in mainland Portugal, Serra da Estrela, reaches just 1993 meters — a far cry from Europe’s tallest mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Peaks extracted extrated from local .OSM.PBF file with osmium. Manual editing in JOSM. Map styling in QGIS. Final composition 
in #Illustrator. Font used: FiraSans.</p>
