<h1>MAP for day 11 - ARCTIC</h1>
<h2>EITHER A HOLE OR AN AXIS</h2>
<p>When it comes to classic rotating globes with stands, the way the Arctic is represented often leaves much to be desired. In most cases, the top of the globe is either punctuated by a hole or occupied by an axis, depending on the stand design. The images illustrate both examples: on the left, an axis from an older globe (circa 1945-1950), and on the right, a hole from a more recent globe (late 1980s). The smaller inset images show the complete globes with their stands.</p>
<p>Let’s give the Arctic a bit of a break, shall we?</p>
