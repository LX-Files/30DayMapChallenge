<h1>MAP for day 17 - COLLABORATIVE MAP</h1>
<h2>UNKNOWN COLLABORATIONS</h2>
<p>This map was initially presented for the Day 10 challenge (Pen and Paper). However, due to time constraints - and since it fits the current brief perfectly - I’m reusing it here.</p>
<p>The map was hand-drawn by at least two, possibly three, people, myself included. I was responsible for the outline, the smaller penciled numbers, and the test numbers and circles drawn in ink. Unfortunately, I can’t recall who contributed the remaining numbers. Regardless, a big thank you to the unknown collaborators!</p>
<p>Map outlines copied from a lost source onto tracing paper with pencil. Raster editing in <b>Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>.</p>
