<h2>WHERE FOOD STILL GROWS FROM THE GROUND IN LISBON</h2> 
<p>There are still a few places within Lisbon where food is grown directly from the ground. Working farms are few and far between, though a handful of orchards and a couple of vineyards remain. In recent years, several urban gardens have appeared throughout the city - and with considerable success.</p>
<p>Many of these patches of cultivated land can be found in the southwestern part of Lisbon, connected to the forest park of Monsanto. There is also a greater concentration of urban gardens toward the east, where some areas remain less developed. Others are scattered across the city, exemplifying a connection to nature that endures even  in Portugal’s largest urban center.</p>
