<h1>MAP for day 9 - ANALOG</h1>
<h2>A HEIGHT MAP IN GRAPH PAPER or ANALOG MUSINGS IN ‘digital’ PAPER</h2> 
<p>The drawing presents a simplified and colored height map of Lisbon. It can serve as a guide for further interpretations, including mosaics made from LEGO pieces or magnetic pixels.</p>
<p>The idea came about when I found an old graph-paper pad from DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation, 1957–1998) and decided to use it, creating a play on words. Hence the page header ‘digital’ for a decidedly analog approach to mapping.</p>
<p>Here’s to DEC: the VAX computer family, the Alpha processors, and many other remarkable products from the same lineage.</p>
<p>Map traced on graph paper over a printed source, using a light table. Drawing made with graphite pencil and colored pencils. Contours traced over with pigment ink.  Raster editing after digitization in <b>Photoshop</b>. Final composition in <b>Illustrator</b>. Font used: <b>FiraSans</b>. Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors (for the municipality contour) and Câmara Municipal de Lisboa (for the height map).</p>
