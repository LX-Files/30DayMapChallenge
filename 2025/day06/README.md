<h2>COUNTING (AND PRINTING) THE HILLS OF LISBON</h2> 
<p>From the 17th century onward, it became common for writers to describe Lisbon as a city spread over seven hills, mirroring Rome. The truth is, however, that the actual number of hills is somewhat debatable. Visitors throughout the years have counted them in different ways. Let’s just say that the older parts of the city are decidedly hilly, offering steep ascents and some remarkable views.</p>
<p>Using a combination of digital tools and techniques, I 3D-printed three of Lisbon’s hills in a single piece, though only one of them belongs to the classic list (Castelo - the one with the Castle of São Jorge). The process began with raster image captures from 3D views in Google Earth, as if a swarm of drones were taking photographs from different heights and angles. Those captures were then used to reconstruct a 3D virtual model of the terrain with RealityCapture software. From that model, I generated an STL file for printing. The process is time-consuming, but the results are worth it.</p>
