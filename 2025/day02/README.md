<h1>MAP for day 2 - LINES</h1>
<h2>HIGH-RESOLUTION CONTOUR LINES</h2> 
<p>The Lisbon city plan, drawn from fieldwork conducted between 1904 and 1911, provides a highly detailed view of the city. One of its key requirements was the inclusion of contour lines covering the entire municipality, at 1-meter intervals. This feature preserved the complete relief of the city as it existed at the beginning of the 20th century, when large parts of the municipality were still undeveloped.</p>
<p>The images illustrate this point.</p>
<p>The top-left image shows an area with a small hill and a fortress located on the southwestern edge of the city (Algés/Restelo), as represented in the original 1904–1911 map. The area is mostly undeveloped, with a small palace (Palácio Cadaval) visible at the bottom. The squarish plots toward the right were part of an army training field. The contour lines are visible, though lightly traced.</p>
<p>The top-right image highlights the contour lines from the same map, showing their highly detailed representation of the area.</p>
<p>The bottom-left image overlays those contour lines onto a recent aerial view of the same area. It is now mostly residential, with one of the lowest population densities in the city. The hill surrounding the fortress has been incorporated into the Monsanto Forest Park.</p>
<p>The bottom-right image presents an approximate 3D view of the same area, generated using Google Earth with the Terrain and 3D Buildings layers enabled.</p>
