<h1>MAP for day 3 - POLYGONS</h1>
<h2>SHAPING THE CITY</h2> 
<p>City planners have at their disposal a variety of polygonal shapes to use when laying out streets - at least in theory. In practice, orthogonal street grids are by far the most common and can be found all around the world. However, there are several notable exceptions alongside these standard forms.</p>
<p>The images above illustrate both common and uncommon cases: from triangles (rarely used), to squares and rectangles (the most typical), to pentagons and hexagons (also quite rare). The ultimate outlier is found in Athens, where some city blocks take on a distinctive lozenge shape - still a four-sided regular polygon, just presented differently.</p>
