<h1>MAP for day 16 - CELL</h1>
<h2>FROM ZERO TO EIGHT CELLS IN TEN YEARS</h2> 
<p>For Day 8 (Urban), I presented an example of urban growth in Lisbon. This is another such case, although one that unfolded entirely during the 20th century. The neighbourhood known as <i>Alvalade</i> simply did not exist in the early decades of that century. Planning began in 1938, and construction followed in 1947.</p>
<p>The project defined several large avenues intended to serve as the structural axes for eight urban “cells.” Each cell was centred around a school, and all residences within it were meant to be no more than 500 meters from that school. The plan also included commercial areas and a wide variety of urban facilities. A deliberate mix of building types enabled zones of higher and lower density, as well as price differentiation to meet diverse needs and economic capacities. Over time, the area became a showcase for the most advanced architectural designs in the city—effectively a “new Lisbon.”</p>
