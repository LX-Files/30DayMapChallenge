<h1>MAP for day 15 - FIRE</h1>
<h2>WHERE THERE’S SMOKE, THERE’S FIRE</h2> 
<p>The 1911 Lisbon city plan contains an impressive wealth of detail about the city. Among its features is the depiction of numerous industrial chimneys - certainly not every one that existed (as photographic evidence shows), but at least the most significant were included.</p>
<p>The red shapes indicate the location of every chimney I was able to identify. Given the city’s structure in the early 20th century, it is only natural that many were close to the river, at once a source of water and a convenient way to dispose of industrial waste. One area stands out in particular: the valley of the Alcântara River, the largest flowing river that once crossed the city. Its lower section hosted a high concentration of industries along the riverbanks, with harmful consequences not only for the river itself but also for the surrounding neighbourhoods. The inset photograph shows a small portion of that valley.</p>
<p>Below the map is a photographic panorama of the riverfront, with the corresponding section marked on the map. The number of chimneys visible in the photo exceeds what is shown in the 1911 city plan, revealing how industries clustered in that area, again with negative environmental impacts.</p>
<p>In the decades that followed, Lisbon underwent profound changes in its industrial geography. The Alcântara valley lost its chimneys, as did much of the downtown riverfront. Meanwhile, the number of chimneys along the northern river margin increased dramatically, including heavy chemical plants and an oil refinery. Fortunately, these too have since disappeared.</p>
