<h1>MAP for day 8 - URBAN</h1>
<h2>URBAN CHANGE, URBAN GROWTH</h2> 
<p>By the end of the 1880s, Lisbon’s city limits were largely set, with only minor adjustments in the decades that followed. More than a century later, after Expo ’98, the city grew slightly beyond those historic boundaries with a small expansion to the north. So when we speak of urban growth in Lisbon, we are mostly referring to an increase in the built-up area within long-established borders. At the same time, we can also speak of urban change, in the sense that many of the areas already within those borders have undergone significant transformation over the years.</p>
<p>These partial city plans and satellite images — both old and recent — illustrate two selected examples of urban change and urban growth.</p>
