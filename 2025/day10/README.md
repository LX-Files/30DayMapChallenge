<h1>MAP for day 10 - AIR</h1>
<h2>THE LISBON NOISE MAP DURING NIGHTTIME</h2> 
<p>A noise map helps illustrate which areas are more or less affected by sound. Based on data from April 2021, the blue–green tones indicate quieter zones, typically open, forested, or residential areas. Gradually, as the colors shift from light green to purple, the city’s road network becomes visible. Unsurprisingly, the most heavily used streets and roads are those that stand out most. The thin purple line near the lower-left portion of the map marks the busy A5 highway, which connects Lisbon to Cascais.</p>
<p>The city is notably crossed by a progressively darker band running from SSW to NNE. This is not a road itself, but one of the aircraft approach and departure paths to and from the airport, visible as the darker lanes toward the top of the map.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Municipality provides this same dataset online through the <a href="https://lisboaaberta.cm-lisboa.pt/index.php/pt/dados/conjuntos-de-dados">Lisboa Aberta</a> portal (search for 'Mapa de Ruído Global'). I adjusted the color ramp following <a href="https://www.coloringnoise.com/theoretical_background/new-color-scheme/">the work and recommendations</a> of Dr. Beate Tomio.</p>
