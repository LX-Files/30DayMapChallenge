<h1>MAP for day 14 - OPENSTREETMAP</h1>
<h2>DATA AT YOUR FINGERTIPS</h2> 
<p>Thanks to the work of countless individuals and organizations around the world, the OpenStreetMap project gives access to an immense amount of raw data from which maps of almost any place can be drawn. And thanks to the efforts of other dedicated contributors, map design can be approached from experimental perspectives, showing that cartography can be not only informative, but also playful and, at times, genuinely beautiful.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps"><b>prettymaps</b></a> project by Marcelo Prates provides an accessible way to generate maps using OpenStreetMap data. This image is a city plan of Lisbon created with that tool. While most examples focus on smaller urban areas, I wanted to see the result when applied to a larger region. No text - just colors and shapes. One could easily spend hours experimenting with different color palettes.</p>
