<h1>MAP for day 18 - OUT OF THIS WORLD</h1>
<h2>A RELAXING WAY OF DRAWING A MAP</h2> 
<p>The Canvas of Kings program by Hannes Bauer (available on Steam) offers a relaxing and delightful way to draw a map from scratch, using elements commonly associated with fantasy worlds. A quick browse through the Steam Workshop reveals many impressive examples of what can be created. Although the tool can be used to recreate real city plans, it is even more enjoyable to lose yourself in places that exist only in imagination - somewhere out of this world.</p>
