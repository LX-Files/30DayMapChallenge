<h1>MAP for day 4 - MY DATA</h1>
<h2>IF NOT THE CITY, AT LEAST THE AIRPORT</h2> 
<p>I’ve been to the airports in these cities - though not always to the cities themselves.</p>
<p>For an avid plane spotter, the idea of <i>airport tourism</i> would not seem out of place. However, for the average traveler, an airport is mostly a means to an end - a place to be tolerated at best, and often regarded as a nuisance.</p>
<p>Air travel remains the fastest way to move from point A to point B - provided those points are several hundred kilometers apart, with no reliable railways between them, or a large body of water in the way. So we fly to visit cities and countries. Yet, because of a complex equation involving distance, aircraft models, ticket pricing, and airline politics, a single trip often becomes a chain of hops between different airports. Sometimes, weather or circumstance forces a detour, and you end up landing somewhere entirely unexpected.</p>
<p><i>If Not the City, At Least the Airport</i> pays homage to those fleeting moments that allow you to say, “Oh - that country? I’ve already been there,” while quietly omitting the fact that you never left the airport (or worse, the plane).</p>
