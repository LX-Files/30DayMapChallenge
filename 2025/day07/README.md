<h1>MAP for day 7 - ACCESSIBILITY</h1>
<h2>WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE</h2> 
<p>Lisbon’s 56 subway stations provide fairly good coverage across much of the city. This map presents a series of isochrones, revealing that most stations aren’t that far from one another. While the five-minute walking range creates several small “islands,” residents within the ten-minute isochrone generally have multiple stations to choose from, except for a few areas near the city’s outer limits.</p>
<p>The westernmost part of Lisbon has traditionally remained untouched by the subway network. However, this will soon change with the planned extension toward Alcântara, which will reshape the 30- and 40-minute isochrones along the riverfront.</p>
<p>The truth is, most of the city is not very far from a subway station - and in many cases, from two or even three.</p>
