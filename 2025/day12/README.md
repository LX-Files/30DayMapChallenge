<h2>(LET'S HOPE THIS WON'T BE) A SATELLITE VIEW FROM THE IBERIAN PENINSULA IN 2125</h2> 
<p>Modelling the effects of climate change is far from straightforward. This image shows one possible scenario: the desertification of the southern Iberian Peninsula as the Sahara Desert expands northward. It represents a plausible outcome of global human activity in a not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>Let’s do our best to prevent this, along with the southward expansion of the Sahara, the continued rise in global temperatures, species extinction, and the loss of biological diversity. Sadly, this page could be filled with examples of things that should be stopped because they pose serious threats to our shared future.</p>
<p>Source for desert expansion:<br/>
Thomas, Natalie, and Sumant Nigam. “Twentieth-century climate change over Africa: Seasonal hydroclimate trends and Sahara desert expansion.” Journal of Climate 31.9 (2018): 3349–3370.<br/>
The authors suggest that such an extent of expansion is plausible by 2100. I simply extended the projection by an additional 25 years.</p>
